# Parcelization-Land-Use-Infrastructure-Planning

These scripts were created for the California Public Utilities Commission Integrated Resource Plan for the 2024-2025 Transmission Planning Process as part of the resource-to-busbar mapping effort. The scripts calculate parcelization, a measure of the average number of unique parcels in an area, for long-term electric system planning. A report describing the methodology and purpose in greater detail is found at https://www.energy.ca.gov/publications/2023/calculating-parcelization-electric-system-planning. 

We are grateful to the ICF, E&P GIS Team Lead and Staff, Eric Link and Greg Nichols, for their support in supplying the overall method procedure.
